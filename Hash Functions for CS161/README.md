These are the functions used by Little Men Designs.

Important:

- The main file of each folders have 10000 strings inside the code. These are the strings used for hashing.
To navigate to the end, try searching for the stop method in each main file (stopwatch.stop() in the case of C#)

- For the general Hash functions, you can change the hash functions used by finding and replacing the hash function already used with the functions desired.

- You can also choose to change these strings with your own strings, provided you have adequate knowledge on these languages.
